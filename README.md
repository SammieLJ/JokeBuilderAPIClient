# Joke Builder API Client
API Client for fetching and storing jokes from Random Joke API

API url (use browser or curl)
https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke

Task that Users should be able to:
* 1.) Fetch jokes (specify the number).
* 2.) View all stored jokes.
* 3.) Search jokes by type.
* 4.) Process multiple jokes (remove N jokes at once).
* 5.) Exit.

And my solution is in Programs.cs. Use "dotnet new console -n JokeBuilder"  and copy&paste code. 

You will need Newtonsoft.Json package, add it:
"dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json --version 13.0.3"

More info about package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/newtonsoft.json/

Did it, as dailly practice to keep with programming skills, minimum usage of GitHub CoPilot in VS Code
